## SQL Project: Pewlett Hackard Employee Data Analysis
Welcome to my SQL project! In this project, I have been tasked with using pgAdmin to execute data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis of the CSV files provided in the "data" folder.

# Project Overview
As part of my role as a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company), I was assigned to conduct a research project focusing on individuals employed by the company during the 1980s and 1990s. The primary dataset consists of six CSV files containing valuable information about employees during that period.

# Folder Structure
Data Modeling
In the main folder, you'll find a PNG file showcasing the QuickDBD data modeling diagram. This diagram provides an overview of the tables and their relationships, aiding in understanding the database structure.

# EmployeeSQL
In the "EmployeeSQL" folder, you will find my final analysis, SQL queries, and table schemas. These components represent the culmination of my data modeling, engineering, and analysis efforts.

# Project Background
Upon joining Pewlett Hackard, my initial task was to dive into the historical employee data. With only CSV files at my disposal, I embarked on the journey of designing appropriate tables to house the data, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and extracting insights through data analysis.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to my class Teaching Assistant (TA) for their prompt assistance whenever I encountered challenges during the project. Their support was invaluable in overcoming obstacles and completing the tasks effectively.

# Conclusion
This project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to sharpen my SQL skills while delving into real-world data analysis. I thoroughly enjoyed the process and look forward to exploring SQL further in future projects.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project! Should you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
